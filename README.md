# Learning `sed`

There are many guides and books for learning `sed`, but few are
interactive. The goal of this project is to provide a number of
lessons with real text files to learn and experiment with. It is
self contained and does not require writing your own example
data.

I am not an expert on `sed`, but want to learn more about it.

## Who Should Use This

This guide is for people who want to learn `sed`. You have some
familiarity with unix system and using the command line. You
have a basic understanding of regular expressions.

## How to Use

Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:josefalcon/learning-sed.git
```

Each lesson is in a separate directory with an example file and
a README. `cd` into the lesson folder, and start learning `sed`!
